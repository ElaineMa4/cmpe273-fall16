## 5. Blockchain-based Smart Contract for Home Builders and Contractors 

### Requirement

> You will be building a simple smart contract that requires two or three digital signatures to release funds.

### Example

* A home owner who needs her kitchen remodel funds a contract and creates three digital signature keys for 
herself, the contractor, and a neutral third party of their choice. 
* If the work is completed, the home owner and contractor both sign and payment is released to the contractor.
* If the home owner and contractor get into an argument over the quality of the work, then they call in the third party who casts the deciding vote for where the money should go.
* It's arbitration without legal overhead of complex contracts.

### Dependency

* You can build your decentralized app on a Blockchain platform like [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)
